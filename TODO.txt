NETWORKING:
-Cap MAX_INPUTS_PER_PACKET/similar also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked or do not need to be networked (see MAX_NETWORK_COMPONENTS). E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?
-Network m_isEnabled variable for all components.

GAMEPLAY:
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.

ENGINE:
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.
-ifdef _DRAW. Do it in all places where something related to draw is used! Try to compile without draw and see what happens.

PLAYLIST:
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers with/without different routers.

NOTES:
-Be careful with the Tile object y position!
-Health bars or points or life or insta kill?

KNOWN ISSUES (Will Not Fix):
-EXPLOIT: remote entities are replicated (updated) when the state is Start. When state is Play and local entity is updated, remote entities are not at the spawn position anymore -> Remote entity shoots at you when you cannot move yet and kills you.
-CRASH: TCP packets == 1470 bytes (MTU) from client to server make server crash. This happens with pretty bad network conditions when a lot of TCP packets are accumulated.
