-Cap MAX BYTES SENT also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets) -> Reset MAX BYTES SENT to a reasonable value.
-Only network those tiles that may change.
-Establish connection with TCP.
-Send unwelcome messages.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.
-Debug draw in a more nice way.
-Debug ImGui options (resize window, etc.).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked.
-Make entities be able to have components that are networked and components that are not.

PLAYLIST:
-Send Bye packet at the Scoreboard screen and if entity disconnects during gameplay.
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers.
-Timeout when Connecting... clients to not wait forever. Return to the SETUP state.

Known bugs:
-Play->Main Menu->Play Again: client delay receiving the state packet + client can still send inputs to server (crash).

----------

-Be careful with the Tile object y position!
-Have debug draw again.
-There are a bunch of components that do not have to be networked. E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?
-Health bars or points or life or insta kill?

BUGS:
-Bug: client does not interpolate until the last position received (maybe it deleats it before). It only goes to the right position if remote entity moves again.
