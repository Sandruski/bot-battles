-Cap MAX BYTES SENT also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets) -> Reset MAX BYTES SENT to a reasonable value.
-Only network those tiles that may change.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.
-Debug draw in a more nice way.
-Debug ImGui options (resize window, etc.).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked.
-Make entities be able to have components that are networked and components that are not.
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.

PLAYLIST:
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers.
-Stop the 1s timeout for TCP because it is horrible. (test it with bad network conditions)
-Not send every Update certain packets (it is too much!). Add a timer or something to do it.

----------

-Be careful with the Tile object y position!
-There are a bunch of components that do not have to be networked. E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?
-Health bars or points or life or insta kill?
-Packets == 1470bytes (MTU) from client to server make server to CRASH. This happens with pretty bad network conditions.
