FIX DIVERGENCES BETWEEN CLIENT AND SERVER WHEN SHOOTING! :(

-Debug draw for AI stuff (gameplay): raycasts, etc.

-Fix networking bug where player wants to replay but then it goes back to main menu and tries to connect again but the server won't allow player because it is already registered in the server map of players.
->Fix the previous point by sending regular "ping" udp packets.

/////

-Perception (sight): I see you, you see me
-Pathfinding: navigation grid component
-Shooting: rotate gun, cooldowns, and reload
-Pick guns from floor: interact() ? with the sprite with the hands forward
-Add animations to every action that the bot can perform
-Add hints to Python bindings, so players know what they are writing




*How do we handle turns?
-Test game between two computers. Test for physics floating point errors.
-Sandbots
-Capture the flag? :)
-Reload the script when Play Again or it does not make any sense to do it?
-Check BUG: the client executed from the exe takes no time to connect and the one just compiled takes a lot. Why???
-Add the ImGui code editor in the client Main Menu to open the selected script, edit it and compile it.
-Posar a la build final la Changelist de cada versiÃ³.

NETWORKING:
-Cap MAX_INPUTS_PER_PACKET/similar also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked or do not need to be networked (see MAX_NETWORK_COMPONENTS). E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?

GAMEPLAY:
-Add animations when the bots perform certain actions.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.

ENGINE:
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.
-ifdef _DRAW. Do it in all places where something related to draw is used! Try to compile without draw and see what happens.

PLAYLIST:
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers with/without different routers.

BUGS (Should Fix):
-ReHello arrives to the server.
-Server replies with ReWelcome.
-ReWecome does not reach client.

KNOWN ISSUES (Will Not Fix):
-EXPLOIT: remote entities are replicated (updated) when the state is Start. When state is Play and local entity is updated, remote entities are not at the spawn position anymore -> Remote entity shoots at you when you cannot move yet and kills you.
-CRASH: TCP packets == 1470 bytes (MTU) from client to server make server crash. This happens with pretty bad network conditions when a lot of TCP packets are accumulated.
