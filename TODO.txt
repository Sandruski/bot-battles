-Cap MAX BYTES SENT also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets) -> Reset MAX BYTES SENT to a reasonable value.
-Only network those tiles that may change.
-Establish connection with TCP.
-Send unwelcome messages.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.
-Spawn positions (1 for player 1 i 2 for player 2).
-Debug draw in a more nice way.
-Debug ImGui options (resize window, etc.).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked.
-Make entities be able to have components that are networked and components that are not.

-Be careful with the Tile object y position!
-Have debug draw again.
-There are a bunch of components that do not have to be networked. E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?
-Health bars or points or life or insta kill?
