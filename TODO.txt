-Cap MAX BYTES SENT also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets) -> Reset MAX BYTES SENT to a reasonable value.
-Only network those tiles that may change.
-Establish connection with TCP.
-Send unwelcome messages.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.
-Debug draw in a more nice way.
-Debug ImGui options (resize window, etc.).
-ImGui panels for debug console.
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked.
-Make entities be able to have components that are networked and components that are not.

PLAYLIST:
-Send Bye packet at the Scoreboard screen and if entity disconnects during gameplay.
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers.

TO DO TOMORROW:
-Timeout when Connecting... (Main Menu) and Waiting... (Scoreboard) clients to not wait forever.
-Handle timeout when playing and server is disconnected.
-Be careful with the UDP disconnect condition == Play. When they are in Start this won't happen (bugs).

***
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.
-Change server Scoreboard ugly ImGui panel.
-Play again and go to main menu loops.
***

----------

-Be careful with the Tile object y position!
-Have debug draw again.
-There are a bunch of components that do not have to be networked. E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?
-Health bars or points or life or insta kill?

BUGS:
-Bug: client does not interpolate until the last position received (maybe it deleats it before). It only goes to the right position if remote entity moves again.
