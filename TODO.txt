-Sandbots.
-Add the ImGui code editor in the client Main Menu to open the selected script, edit it and compile it.

NETWORKING:
-Cap MAX_INPUTS_PER_PACKET/similar also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets).

ENGINE:
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.
-Els sistemes s'haurien de subscriure a events, no a altres sistemes tirant events.

BUGS (Should Fix):
-ReHello arrives to the server>Server replies with ReWelcome>ReWecome does not reach client.

KNOWN ISSUES (Will Not Fix):
-EXPLOIT: remote entities are replicated (updated) when the state is Start. When state is Play and local entity is updated, remote entities are not at the spawn position anymore -> Remote entity shoots at you when you cannot move yet and kills you.
-CRASH: TCP packets == 1470 bytes (MTU) from client to server make server crash. This happens with pretty bad network conditions when a lot of TCP packets are accumulated.
