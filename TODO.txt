-Sight.
-OnCollisionExit.
-Bots die in more than one shot.
-Ammo on floor and pick up ammo.

-Create Location struct (for a tile) and Bot struct (for an enemy bot object?) for scripting purposes.
-Pathfinding stuff, mapping Location from world to map positions.
-Send onCollision Entity struct to scripting. E.g. if it is a wall, the properties. If it is an entity, the position.

-Debug draw for AI stuff (gameplay): raycasts, etc.

/////

-Perception (sight): I see you, you see me
-Pathfinding: navigation grid component
-Shooting: rotate gun, cooldowns, and reload
-Pick guns from floor: interact() ? with the sprite with the hands forward
-Add animations to every action that the bot can perform
-Add hints to Python bindings, so players know what they are writing




*How do we handle turns?
-Test game between two computers. Test for physics floating point errors.
-Sandbots
-Capture the flag? :)
-Reload the script when Play Again or it does not make any sense to do it?
-Check BUG: the client executed from the exe takes no time to connect and the one just compiled takes a lot. Why???
-Add the ImGui code editor in the client Main Menu to open the selected script, edit it and compile it.
-Posar a la build final la Changelist de cada versiÃ³.

NETWORKING:
-Cap MAX_INPUTS_PER_PACKET/similar also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked or do not need to be networked (see MAX_NETWORK_COMPONENTS). E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?

GAMEPLAY:
-Add animations when the bots perform certain actions.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.

ENGINE:
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.
-ifdef _DRAW. Do it in all places where something related to draw is used! Try to compile without draw and see what happens.

PLAYLIST:
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers with/without different routers.

BUGS (Should Fix):
-ReHello arrives to the server.
-Server replies with ReWelcome.
-ReWecome does not reach client.

KNOWN ISSUES (Will Not Fix):
-EXPLOIT: remote entities are replicated (updated) when the state is Start. When state is Play and local entity is updated, remote entities are not at the spawn position anymore -> Remote entity shoots at you when you cannot move yet and kills you.
-CRASH: TCP packets == 1470 bytes (MTU) from client to server make server crash. This happens with pretty bad network conditions when a lot of TCP packets are accumulated.
