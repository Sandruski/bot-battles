SCRIPTING:

Perception:
Dijous:
*MOVEMENT. Collision System. Move and collide with walls. Notify when collide and return struct with useful info so players can implement steering behaviors.
*Pathfinding.
*Tile-based movement?

Divendres:
*PERCEPTION. Sight. Last known position, etc.

Divendres:
*SHOOTING. Rotate gun, cooldown and shoot.
->shoot()
->reload()



*Turns. How do we handle them?


-Add animations to every action that the bot can perform.
->interact() ? with the sprite with the hands forward
-Add hints to Python bindings, so players know what they are writing.
-Capture the flag? :)
-Sandbots








-Reload the script when Play Again or it does not make any sense to do it?
-Check BUG: the client executed from the exe takes no time to connect and the one just compiled takes a lot. Why???
-Add the ImGui code editor in the client Main Menu to open the selected script, edit it and compile it.

NETWORKING:
-Cap MAX_INPUTS_PER_PACKET/similar also for State packets (already doing it for Input packets).
-Remove Networking inheritance for those components that are actually not being networked or do not need to be networked (see MAX_NETWORK_COMPONENTS). E.g. if Health is not printed then why would the player want it?

GAMEPLAY:
-Add animations when the bots perform certain actions.
-Add 'Random map' option with ImGui to select a map from all the existing maps.

ENGINE:
-Change FSM to not be based on the type of the state and be a vector instead.
-ifdef _DRAW. Do it in all places where something related to draw is used! Try to compile without draw and see what happens.

PLAYLIST:
-Check that 2 players can connect to the game from different computers with/without different routers.

KNOWN ISSUES (Will Not Fix):
-EXPLOIT: remote entities are replicated (updated) when the state is Start. When state is Play and local entity is updated, remote entities are not at the spawn position anymore -> Remote entity shoots at you when you cannot move yet and kills you.
-CRASH: TCP packets == 1470 bytes (MTU) from client to server make server crash. This happens with pretty bad network conditions when a lot of TCP packets are accumulated.
